# 🛡️ CypherRing: Financial Forensics Engine
### **RIFT 2026 Hackathon | Graph-Based Financial Crime Detection Track**

**CypherRing** is a high-performance forensics engine engineered to expose money muling networks. The application transforms complex transaction data into graph structures to autonomously detect illicit financial patterns.

## 👥 The Team: Synergy X
* **Vaibhav Singh** (Team Lead) — *Lead Architect & Graph Logic* 🏗️
* **Antra Priyadarshini** — *UX/UI & Interactive Graph Visualization* 🎨
* **Srishti Maurya** — *Algorithm Optimization & Technical Documentation* 📝

## 🧠 Core Detection Methodology
Our engine specifically targets the mandatory forensic patterns required by RIFT 2026:

### 1. Circular Fund Routing (Cycles)
* **Logic**: Identification of closed-loop chains (3 to 5 hops) where funds eventually return to the source account to obscure the trail.


### 2. Smurfing Patterns (Fan-in / Fan-out)
* **Fan-in**: Detection of a single aggregator account receiving funds from 10+ distinct senders.
* **Fan-out**: Identification of a single sender dispersing funds to 10+ distinct receivers.
* **Temporal Analysis**: High-priority flagging for suspicious transactions occurring within a critical 72-hour window.

### 3. Layered Shell Networks
* **Logic**: Exposing intermediate "shell" accounts characterized by low transaction counts (2-3 total) that serve as transit points for layering.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Backend**: Python (Flask)
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (D3.js for Interactive Graph Visualizations)
* **Graph Engine**: NetworkX for $O(V + E)$ cycle detection efficiency.
